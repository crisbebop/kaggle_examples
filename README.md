# XBoost Classifier Optimization with Optuna
This is an case study as an basic example of how to use Optuna to optimize XGBoost classifier hyperparameters, especifically, the sampling was applieded to `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, `eta` and `reg_lambda`.  
## The dataset  
We used the Kaggle [Loan Approval Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/data) that contains person key features.

|8  |loan_int_rate             |                              |
|9  |loan_percent_income       |                              |
|10 |cb_person_default_on_file |                              |
|11 |cb_person_cred_hist_length|                              |
|12 |loan_status               | Whether loan aprroved (Yes/No)|

The shape of training dataset is (58645, 13).

## The model
We use the dataset features to build a model that determines whether a person should get a loan or not. In this case, we trained an XGBoost classifier in two ways:
* Baseline model without adjusting hyperparameters
* Optimized model, based on an Optuna search

In both cases, we used scikit-learnâ€™s cross_val_score to compare the average ROC_AUC metric.  
The goal is to find the best hyperparameters to improve the score.

## Results
The baseline model achieved a ROC_AUC score of 0.9479, while the optimized model reached 0.9605 after 30 trials.  
In the search, the most important hyperparameter was max_depth.
